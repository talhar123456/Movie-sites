                To entertain, movies produce an aesthetic effect
                (art emotional reactions), movies carry messages
                (reflect, comment on, and amplify the human conditon,
                and sometimes even influence), and they displace the viewer
                from everyday life into another world and mood. These inseperately
                converge as the creative artist expresses these with varying
                emphases through the communication of movies. The concern of the
                reviewer is whether the creative artist communicated his emphases
                effectively with the audience, and was it entertaining.
