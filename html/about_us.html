                            A movie theater (American English),[1] cinema (British English)[2] 
                        or cinema hall (Indian English)[3] is a building that contains an 
                        auditorium for viewing films (also called movies) for entertainment. 
                        Most, but not all, theaters are commercial operations catering to the 
                        general public, who attend by purchasing a ticket. Some movie theaters, 
                        however, are operated by non-profit organizations or societies which 
                        charge members a membership fee to view films.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The film is projected with a movie projector onto a large projection 
                        screen at the front of the auditorium while the dialogue, sounds and 
                        music are played through a number of wall-mounted speakers. Since the 
                        1970s, subwoofers have been used for low-pitched sounds. In the 2010s, 
                        most movie theaters are equipped for digital cinema projection, removing 
                        the need to create and transport a physical film print on a heavy reel.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A great variety of films are shown at cinemas, ranging from animated films 
                        to blockbusters to documentaries. The smallest movie theaters have a single
                        viewing room with a single screen. In the 2010s, most movie theaters have 
                        multiple screens. The largest theater complexes, which are called 
                        multiplexes—a design developed in the US in the 1960s—have up to thirty 
                        screens. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The audience members often sit on padded seats, which in most 
                        theaters are set on a sloped floor, with the highest part at the rear of 
                        the theater. Movie theaters often sell soft drinks, Popcorn, and Candy,
                        and some theaters sell hot Fast Food. In some jurisdictions, movie 
                        theaters are licensed to sell alcoholic drinks.
